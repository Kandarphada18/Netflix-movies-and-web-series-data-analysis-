# Netflix-movies-and-web-series-data-analysis-
he Netflix Data Visualization Project is an interactive Python-based analysis tool designed to explore insights from the Netflix titles dataset.
The goal of this project is to understand patterns in Netflix’s content library — such as movie vs. TV show distribution, content ratings, release year trends, and country-wise availability — through data cleaning, processing, and visualization.

The project begins by importing and preprocessing raw data from a CSV file. Missing values are handled using Pandas, while NumPy is used to generate descriptive statistics and perform numerical analysis on key features such as release year and title counts.
To make the analysis interactive, the project uses a menu-driven command-line interface, allowing users to select their preferred type of visualization.

Visual representations are built using Matplotlib, including:

Histograms to show the distribution of release years

Bar charts comparing the number of movies and TV shows

Pie charts for rating distributions

Horizontal bar charts highlighting the top 10 countries by content volume

The project concludes with a creative animated exit, using Matplotlib’s dynamic plotting features to display an engaging sine-wave animation that thanks the user — demonstrating both technical and creative coding skills.

This project showcases core data analysis techniques and the ability to combine logic, visualization, and interactivity. It emphasizes practical implementation of Python libraries for real-world exploratory data analysis (EDA) and provides a foundation for expanding into machine learning applications such as recommendation systems or trend predictions.
